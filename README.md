A little overview of the FSM classes I use in my godot projects.
There are 2 little example agents that have their own (very) primitive AI, and interact in the game world.
Most scripts are heavily anotated to give some guidelines on how they should be used, and to share some thoughts I have and some things I am unsure about.
